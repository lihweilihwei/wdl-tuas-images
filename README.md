Python scripts to download images from the [Onemotoring website](https://www.onemotoring.com.sg/content/onemotoring/home/driving/traffic_information/traffic-cameras/woodlands.html), add timestamps on each frame and rename them to be stitched together into a video using ffmpeg.

# Background
On 18 March 2020, Malaysia implemented travel restrictions in response to COVID-19. As a result, traffic volumes at the two border crossings between Singapore and Malaysia (Woodlands Causeway and Tuas Second Link) decreased drastically, except for a handful of goods vehicles carrying essential cargo. This timelapse is made from publicly available traffic images provided by the Land Transport Authority. The images were collected from 9pm, 19 March 2020 to 9pm 20 March 2020, capturing a moment in history when the causeway fell (relatively) silent.
